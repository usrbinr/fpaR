## Introduction

In many fpaR functions, you will see a reference to a calendar_type argument which may confuse most of you, isn't there only one type of calendar?

To accomodate the uniqueness of some industries, financial planning analysis will often involve two calendar systems:

1. **Standard Calendar**  
2. **5-5-4 Calendar**  

This vignette explains the differences between these calendars and their typical use cases.

## Standard Calendar

This is your "typical" calendar also known as a conventional Gregorian calendar:

- 12 months of varying lengths (28–31 days)
- 52 weeks per year (sometimes 53 in leap years)
- Months are uneven in length, which can cause challenges in period-over-period comparison

For most of your analysis this is most likely the calendar "type" that you need to follow
**Example:**

| Month | Days |
|-------|------|
| January | 31 |
| February | 28 (29 in leap year) |
| March | 31 |
| ... | ... |
| December | 31 |

The advantage of this calendar type is that it matches most internal / external reporting timelines since this is the calendar that we mainly used to plan or schedules our lives

The primary disadvantage of this calendar is that when you try to compare a metric, lets say revenue, across periods you can easily compare periods with uneven days (eg. comparing January sales to February sales)

This can lead to misleading conclusions that revenue is increasing or decreasing


## 5-5-4 Calendar

The **5-5-4 calendar** is commonly used in retail designed to simplify period-over-period comparisons which a standard calendar introduces

- Each quarter has **13 weeks**, divided into three periods: 5 weeks, 5 weeks, 4 weeks
- Each month in the quarter has a fixed number of weeks (rather than days)
- Some years include a **53rd week** to align with the solar calendar

**Example of a Quarter in 5-5-4 Calendar:**

| Period | Weeks |
|--------|------|
| Month 1 | 5 |
| Month 2 | 5 |
| Month 3 | 4 |

# Comparison

| Feature | Standard Calendar | 5-5-4 Calendar |
|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| Basis | Days in month | Weeks in period |
| Month Length | Varies (28–31 days) | Fixed (4 or 5 weeks) |
| Year Alignment | Calendar year | Usually aligned to fiscal year starting on a specific day (e.g., Sunday) |
| Best for | General reporting, financial statements | Retail, period-over-period sales and inventory analysis |


## How to reference in `fpaR` functions?

Where you see `calandar_type` argument in function you can either put in "standard" to get a traditional calendar or you can put "554" or  "445" to get the alternative cealndar equivalents.

Under the hood `fpaR` will create and convert your calendar to right calendar types an the functions will correctly index of the new keys.
